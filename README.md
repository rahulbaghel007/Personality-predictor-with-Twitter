# Twitter-Personalities

A Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning and Data Mining project, which will automate the screening process before hiring a professional or can be used in psychiatry to check effectivity of patient therapy.  
● Use the Twitter REST API to mine tweets for personality identification.  
● Create n-grams and word vectors for the hashtags, emoticons and phrases using NLP techniques like TF-IDF.  
● Train the machine to classify the personality types by using a Naive-Bayes Text Classifier.  
● Accurately predict the user’s Myers-Briggs personality type using 10-fold cross validation.  

How to use: 
1. run pyGen first to generate your naive bayes classifier models. Alternatively, you can use any other text classification models.  
2. run pyPredict(use your own Twitter keys) and enter the username you want to predict.
